# DSP
Experimental repository containing some basic signal operations, such as creation, normalization, producing sound, extracting harmonics etc. Specifically, notebook is divided into the following parts:

- Noise signal generation, plotting, sounding and saving as a .wav file
- Random sinusoidal signal generation generation, plotting, sounding and saving as a .wav file
- A basic additive synthesis example using a sinusoidal signal
- A basic additive synthesis example using a sinusoidal signal, producing an organ-like sound. 
- Application of Fourier transform on previous signal
- Reconstruction of signal using inverse Fourier tranform.

For every prementioned signal there's also a respective .wav file saved in folder "Sound Files". They've all been quantized using 16-bit PCM, in order to support Media Player's codec.
